		<p>This is the story of Adi Mano. Adi was born with a much longer name, almost 14 characters. While that is a relatively medium sized name in India, it is an incredibly long name in the United States. Regardless, the length of his name did not bother Adi until he had to fill in bubbles in his test forms. Then it became very annoying.
		<br>
		<br>
		So annoying that he decided to go by a nickname to reduce the time it took to fill in the bubbles in test forms. He enjoyed this lazy solution to his problem until he reached college where the average class size was 100 people. Once again Adi could no longer employ his ridiculous solution to his ridiculous problem. As a result, once again, Adi once more became Adithya.

		Here are some of my favority Joker quotes.
		<br>
		<br>
		Don't talk like one of them. You're not! Even if you'd like to be. To them, you're just a freak, like me! They need you right now, but when they don't, they'll cast you out, like a leper! You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these... these civilized people, they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve.
